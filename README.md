# deltav_calculator

deltav_calculator is a Python package which includes the data and functions to calculate the delta-v budget for basic maneuvres. A function is also implemented which can be used to determine the delta-v requirement between any two planets in the solar system, additionally giving an estimate for the travel time.

# Detailed description

Includes functions which can be used to calculate the delta-v required for various orbital maneuvers as well as interplanetary missions. Also includes data for the masses and average radii of the sun and planets. The formulas used include Keppler's third law, the Vis-viva equation and expressions derived using energy conservation. The data was sourced from the following Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size.
